Added: Save minimap image feature
Added: Mark Wall & Concrete owner side feature. Available as 4th toggle button "Own" below minimap (or Ctrl+W).
       "Show unknown specials" option was moved under Settings menu.
Fixed: Outpost and Modified Outpost are visually distinguished by antenna turn direction.
Changed: Spice Bloom graphics is now transparent
Fixed: The "Maximized" window property is now preserved for all dialogs when you close and open program again.
Fixed: The last used directory for various open/save dialogs is preserved independently for each dialog.
Fixed: Some key shortcuts (i.e. Ctrl+G) will no longer select a preset
Fixed: Scrolling map with arrows will always work in Terrain mode
Added: In Structures mode, use Up/Down keys to select building/unit in a list, and Left/Right keys to switch between
       Misc Objects, Building and Unit lists
Added: You can use Shift + mouse wheel up/down to change brush size
Added: You can hold Ctrl + click to map to easily and quickly switch to Select mode and start a selection 
Added: Select structures only mode. You can set the checkbox "Structures" next to "Select mode" radio button to
       third (grayed) state, which means select structures only. Useful for copying or moving a base layout.
Added: Area type in Select mode. You can make a selection only of tiles of specified type, which makes possible to
       select more precise non-rectangle areas. If you hold Shift, the selected area is erased, which makes possible to
       easily move the area around.
Added: Using "Reopen map" immediately after starting program will open the map which was open last time.
Added: New dialog window to change a tileset. When you start new map, this dialog will open so you can select a tileset.
Added: Named tilesets. You can give tileset a user-friendly name which will display on tileset selection dialog. 
Added: Reload tileset option. Useful when you modify tileset .ini file.
Changed: In D2kEditor.ini file, the default tileset is not specified as tileset index, but as tileset name 
         (setting was renamed to "DefaultTilesetName").
Changed: Editor will ask for saving changes to your map upon closing program instead of only confirming exiting program.
         This works for map and events modifications, does not work for mission properties and AI modificatios. 
Added: When starting editor for first time and it can't detect your game location automatically, it will prompt you to
       navigate to game location manually with a file open dialog
Added: Editor checks for more map errors when saving map or launching map. It checks additionally for:
       - Spice blooms limit (30 max)
       - Total structures limit (1000 max)
       - Refineries per player limit (10 max)
       - 0 credits or tech level on player with active AI
       - Reinforcement or Starport delivery events with 0 units

Fixed: Map statistics grid scrolling with mouse wheel
Added: Tile Attribute Editor will warn and ask you when you attempt to save over original game's TILEATRx.BIN file
Added: Editor will load contents of custom TEXT.UIB file, if it is specified in mission .ini file.
       The "Test map" feature will automatically launch game with custom TEXT.UIB file.
Added: Preset Helper feature (accessible from "Open tileset" window). Here you can easily design a block preset and copy
       its code to tileset .ini file, or directly use that block in terrain editor.
Fixed: Event and Condition notes will move position accordingly when you reorganize, delete or add events/conditions
Added: Buttons to move units and conditions up and down in event's unit and condition list
Added: New Deploy action "Stay" for Reinforcement and Unit Spawn events, renamed other deploy actions

Added: Player names loaded from "config\players.ini" file are used in all places in editor and no longer hardcoded
Added: Minimap colors for buildings and units are loaded from game's COLOURS.BIN file. Original COLOURS.BIN file
       is shipped with editor.
Changed: Allegiance buttons on Mission settings window are changing in this order: Enemy -> Ally -> Neutral
Added: Defence areas can be selected directly from map. A button will appear when you select a defence area in AI editor.
Added: You can select multiple properties in AI editor on Mission dialog and set same value to all of them at once.
       Hold Shift + Up/Down arrow keys to select a continuous range.
Added: Use random paint map feature. Predefined 128*128 background map of clean sand and rock is used for painting.
       The advantage is better distribution of random sand/rock tiles and more natural look. Can be turned on in Settings.
Fixed: Spacebar was not always working for switching from block preset window to tileset window
Added: Remap tiles feature
Added: Debug window. Accessible from Help menu. It will show some internal values, most importantly paths
       to currently loaded files (configuration, graphics) to easily track which modded files are used.
Added: Built-in Mission Browser / Launcher, showing a table with mission details (name, author, ...)
       providing easy overview of all of your mission settings. You can select specific columns to be shown or not.
Changed: The way how "Unassign .mis file" option and unchecking "Use mission .ini file..." checkbox behaves.
         When you save the map, it will delete .MIS/.ini file from disk.
Added: "D2k Mapping Manual" document

Major new features and changes:
1) Editor loads building and unit graphics and configuration from game's files (Templates.bin, DATA.R16).
   Buildings and units are displayed in exactly same way as shown in-game, supporting mods!
2) Added Structures Editor where you can edit buildings, units, weapons, armour and much more.
   This is going to be a better replacement of TibEd, having much more features!
3) Added support for new Mission Launcher, which means support for loading 
   per-mission/per-mod graphics, configuration, player names and colors.
4) Merged TileAtrEditor program into D2kEditor, so D2kEditor now has built-in Tile Attribute editor. 
   TileAtrEditor became obsolete and no longer needed.
5) Significant improvements related to creating maps using custom tilesets. 
   Creating maps using custom tilesets is now much easier and faster.
6) Major changes in tileset configurations (tileset .ini files) related to new features and improvements.
   You will need to update your custom tileset .ini files to make them compatible with this version of program.

Ad 1)
- The file "graphics\structures.bmp" is no longer distributed with editor. Instead, editor loads building and unit
  graphics from game's internal "DATA.R16" file.
- The files "config\structures.ini", "config\buildings.txt" and "config\units.txt" are no longer distributed with editor.
  Instead, editor loads building and unit names and configuration from game's internal "Templates.bin" file.
- Buildings and units should be displayed in exactly same way as shown in game. Editor tries to mimic the game's way
  of rendering graphics as most faithfully as possible. There's still possibility for minor differences and inaccuracy.
- The building and unit names in lists and event/condition descriptions are taken directly from "Templates.bin" file
  and prettified (converted from ugly uppercase to easier-to-look-at lowercase). So instead of for example
  "Construction Yard (A)" there will be "Atreides Construction Yard".
- On Structures tab there is a yellow stripe telling which building or unit version will be placed for selected side.
- The "Use allocation indexes" setting was changed to "Use alloc. index colors". If turned off, players with changed 
  allocation index will have building versions according to alloc. index, but color according to player index.
- Full support for modded game's graphics and building/unit configuration, no need to modify any editor's files.

Ad 2)
- Available from main menu under "Structures" -> "Structures editor", or Ctrl+X shortcut
- Support for editing Templates.bin, BUILEXP.BIN, ARMOUR.BIN, SPEED.BIN, TECHPOS.BIN files + DATA.R16 and SOUND.RS
- More user-friendly user interface than TibEd, most of unknown bytes were given corrent meaning
- Live preview of building and unit appearance
- Support for adding, removing, renaming, copy&paste of buildings, units, weapons, explosions, armour types, warheads;
  export and import into files for easy sharing and storage  
- Support export and import of arts into files (a group of R16 images) for easy sharing and stogare.
  It is still needed to use Resource editor to modify actual images.
- Export and import of sound effects stored in SOUND.RS file into .WAV files
- Use "Apply changes" to see changes in map and misssion editor
- Use "Save and test" to immediately test your changes in currently loaded map

Ad 3)
- New fields under additional Mission.ini file settings:
  "Campaign folder", "Mods folder", "Colours.bin file", "Players.ini file", "Intel ID"
- Editor can load custom COLOURS.BIN file for individual mission, specified under "Colours.bin file" field
- Editor can load custom player names from .ini file for individual mission, specified under "Players.ini file" field
- Editor can load modified buildings&units graphics for individual mission from specified Campaign and Mods folder
- Editor can load modified buildings&units configuration for individual mission from specified Campaign and Mods folder
- Last two points are useful for mapping with modded game resources (i.e. new/replaced units)
- Editor can load tileset graphics&attributes for individual mission from specified Campaign and Mods folder 
- Editor will load following graphics/config files for individual mission from this folder structure:

{Dune2000 root folder}
|- CustomCampaignData
  |- {Campaign folder}
     |- Colours
        |- {Colours.bin file}
     |- Players
        |- {Players.ini file}
     |- {Mods folder}
        |- graphics
           |- misc_objects.bmp
        |- config
           |- misc_objects.ini
           |- limits.ini
           |- players.ini
        |- tilesets
           |- BLOX****.ini
        |- data
           |- bin

              |- TILEDATA.BIN
              |- TILEATR*.BIN
           |- DATA.R16
           |- BLOX****.R16
           |- GAMESFX
              |- SOUND.RS
           |- UI_DATA
              |- Text.UIB
              |- samples.uib


Ad 4)
- Tile Attribute editor is now available from main menu under "Tileset" -> "Tile attributes editor", or Ctrl+A shortcut
- You can edit the current tileset used by current map. Swithching tileset would change it for current map too. 
- You save map and tile attributes independently. When you save attributes, changes will apply immediately to your map.
- There is "Test in-game" feature (F8) that would save attributes and launch current map in game.

- You can now edit all 32 game attributes. Previously only 7 attributes (which were present in original TILEATRx.BIN files)
  were editable, but according to latest TILEATRx.BIN research, it was discovered that the other attributes are internal
  attributes used by game during gameplay for various purposes. You can achieve various effects using those additional
  attributes, for example place a real working concrete on a map.
- Editor attributes (special attributes used only by the editor to recognize which tile is sand, rock, dune tile etc.) are
  no longer part of TILEATRx.BIN files, because they conflicted with internal game attributes. You no longer need to 
  distribute two separate versions of TILEATRx.BIN files: one for game and one for editor.
- Editor attributes are stored inside tileset .ini file and editor saves them into .ini file automatically.
- TILEATRx.BIN files are no longer distributed with the program. The program loads these files from game folder.

- Added more flexible ways how you can filter tiles by attributes. Added "Filter tiles having any of attributes" mode,
  as well as "Filter tiles by rule" mode. Removed "Mark infantry-only" mode as this was just a specific case of a rule.
- "Filter tiles by rule" is the most advanced mode, where you can specify which attributes tiles need to have (either
  all of any of them) and which attributes tiles must not have (basically combination of all three previous filter modes).
  In this mode you can easily design your rule and then use it in your tileset .ini file.
- Added new view modes: "Draw minimap colors" and "Draw fill area groups" mode. These modes can help you design minimap
  color rules and fill area rules in your tileset .ini file, as you can easily and immediately see the result here.
- Added "Edit tile hint text" mode. Tile hint text is a text that displays in game when you move mouse cursor over that
  tile. In original tilesets this is used only on spice tiles.

Ad 5)
- In Terrain editing mode, there are now 4 common paint groups and 8 tileset-specific paint groups (12 paint groups total).
- The 4 common pain groups are reserved for Thin Spice, Thick Spice, Concrete and Void. The latter two are not commonly
  used in maps, but are potentially usable for new designs, or in custom tilesets. For example concrete can be used for
  decoration (in original tilesets it cannot be built on it), but it can be made buildable using specific tile attributes 
  and used as real concrete in for example Dune 2 tileset. The Void could be used to make non-rectangle maps, or it is 
  useful for indoors tilesets (i.e. Heighliner).
- The 8 paint groups can be used for any terrain types. The original tilesets use no more tha 3 types (Sand/Rock/Dunes) 
  or 4 types (Ice), however, in custom tilesets you can use all 8.
- Improved "Auto-Smooth edges" feature (Shift-Click) and made it more flexible and configurable for custom tilesets.
  You can take advantage of this feaure for any terrain type in custom tilesets, it is not strictly limited for
  Rock and Dunes edge in original tilesets.
- Added "Restrict painting" feature, which will let you paint specific tiles only on specific terrain type (i.e. spice and
  dunes can be painted only on sand, concrete can be painted only on rock). This can be turned off in Settings menu.
- Added support for block presets with "blank" tiles. You can now have presets of any shape (not strictly rectangle shape).

Ad 6)
- Added "name" property under [Basic] section for specification of user-friendly tileset name
- Added "version" property to determine compatibility with specific version of editor
- Changed the way how rules (minimap color rules, fill area rules) are specified. Rules are now specified in this form:
  $attrubites_tile_must_have
  -OR-
  $attrubites_tile_must_have;$attrubites_tile_must_not_have
  If $attrubites_tile_must_have is negative, it means tile must have ANY of specified attributes.
  To design a rule, you can simply use specific filter on Tile Attributes editor and just copy the rule specification.
- The minimap colors are now specified in "$RRGGBB" format instead of "$BBGGRR" format.
- Fill area rules now have names. The names correspond to area types in Select mode.
- Editor attribute names are customizable, which can help understand the meaning and purpose of specific attribute
- You can specify up to 12 paint groups in [Paint_Tile_Groups] section.
  Groups A,B,C,D are reserved for thin spice, thick spice, concrete and void.
  Groups 1-8 are tileset-specific groups you can use for any terrain type.
- The list of tiles used by a paint group is no longer specified by marking those tiles by editor attributes 
  (Paint type 1-4), but directly as part of paint group specification ("GroupX.paint_tiles"). You can specify same tile
  number multiple times, which would increase probability of that tile being randomly selected.
- The block presets used by "Auto-smooth edges" feature (Shift-click) are specified with "GroupX.smooth_preset_group" and
  "Group2.smooth_presets" properties. The presets are specified as list of keys on keyboard. There are three different 
  modes of "Auto-smooth edges" feature:
  1) 20 presets mode: used by original Dune2000 tilesets. Uses 12 1x1 blocks and 8 2x2 curved blocks.
  2) 12 presets mode: uses only 1x1 blocks (4 straight blocks, 4 corners, 4 inner turns).
  3) 14 presets mode: 12 presets plus two double-corner presets (used in for example Warcraft 2 tilesets)
- Added paint group restruction rule, which can be specified as "GroupX.restriction_rule"
- The [Spice_Settings] section was completely removed. The spice minimap colors are now specified as additional minimap 
  color rules. The thin/thick spice name, tile and restriction rule is specified as part of paint group A and B.
- Spice is now also specified as separate fill area group.
- Changed way how custom block presets (= blocks consisting of tiles not continuously arranged in tileset) are specified.
  You no longer need to specify them under separate [Custom_Blocks] section, but directly under [Block_Preset_Group_X]
  section along with standard blocks. To distinguish custom blocks, the width and height must be negative.
  You can utilize "Preset Helper" feature to easily design a block preset, and then copy its code and paste to .ini file.
- Normal block presets are represented as "width.height.tileset_x.tileset.y", but you can newly specify them also in
  simplified form "width.height.tile_index"
- Added "default_paint_group" under [Basic] section which is used to fill a new map. If not specified, group 1 is used.

- You can paint spice in Terrain mode instead of Structures mode.
- Added new "Block preset selection" window where you can see all presets for selected group in the same order
  as how you select them with the keyboard. It can be displayed by clicking on current block, double-clicking on 
  block-preset group or pressing space two times. Use right-click to change to next block variant, middle-click to
  display keyboard keys and Tab to change variant for all presets.
  If you set "HidePresetWindow" setting in D2kEditor.ini to 0, the window will stay open after selecting a preset.
- Added presets also all for tileset-specific blocks
- Each tileset has its own .ini file. There you can configure minimap colors, names of paint and block-preset groups,
  block presets and other things. This way you can easily add custom tilesets and tailor the editor for using them.



Version 1.0 (released 2015-07-10)
---------------------------------
Added: "Smooth rock/dunes edge" feature:
       - Select "Paint Rock" or "Paint Dunes", and then Shift-Click somewhere onto the edge of rock or dunes area. 
         All the edge will become smoothed: the rock/dunes tiles neighbouring with sand are turned into edge tiles.
       - The smoothing process starts in the point you click on and continues in the counterclockwise direction.
       - The process ends when any obstacle is encountered. That means you need to click onto appropriate tile.
       - The smoothed edge sometimes won't look as good as if you made it manually.
Added: New editor-specific tileset attributes are used in order to make the "Smooth edges" feature work properly.
       These attributes are also used in "Fill area" feature. Modified TILEATRx.BIN files are distributed with the editor.
Added: Ice has its own color on minimap
Added: You can drag .map files into editor window to open them
Added: Copy&Paste feature: You can copy and transfer selected block between two instances of the editor
Added: New key shortcuts for spice (ctrl+Q, ctrl+W) and selecting player (Num 0 - Num 6) in Structures mode
Added: Map name is shown in window title
Added: Program now stores persistent settings in D2kEditor.ini file:
       - Editor window position and size is preserved when you close and open editor again.
       - Game path is is stored in ini file and can be edited.
       - Several default values are stored in ini file and can be edited.
       - Several preferences are stored in ini file and can be edited. More preferences will be possibly added in future.
Added: Tileset window is vertically resizable

Complete Mission (.mis file) editor was implemented. Program was renamed to "Dune 2000 Map and Mission Editor".
- Two new windows were added: "Mission settings" and "Events and conditions"
- Added support for map .ini file features (supported by FunkyFr3sh's Dune 2000 Patch and Mission launcher)
- Event editor provides complete tabular overview of events, with detailed information about events and their conditions.
- Events can be easily manipulated (move up/down, insert event, delete event, duplicate event etc.)
- "Create common events" feature: You can quickly create events like Harvester replacement, or add flag to run the event only once.
- Added event and condition notes (stored in map .ini file). If you set note to a Flag condition it is displayed like Flag name.
- You can directly edit Message text in event editor (if map .ini is used)
- You can easily set reinforcement (and other event) position by using "Go to map" and then clicking into map. You can also 
  drag event markers in map editor to move the events. Double-click on event marker to show the event in Event editor.
- You can easily edit all AI properties (which are known). The list of AI properties (and some other configuration) is stored
  externally and can be modified.
- Added "Mark defence areas" feature (they are stored within AI and known uses are only in A4V1 and H4V1 Fremen bases).



Alpha 0.6 (released 2015-05-30)
-------------------------------
Added: "Mark tiles" option also to Tileset window. Buildable tiles are marked there too.
Added: "Edit" menu with Undo and Redo options
Added: Press TAB key to switch between Structures and Terrain mode
Added: "Show unknown specials" feature
Added: If more events (Reinforcements etc) are placed in one tile, additional markers are dwawn next to that tile
Added: If mouse cursor is moved over Reinforcement or Spawn marker, list of units is displayed. Works in Structures mode.
Changed: Minimap is updated after you finish painting of sand/rock/dunes/spice, because rendering was very slow.
Added: "Fill area" feature: works with sand, rock, dunes and spice.
       - You need to double-click into a tile inside area you want to fill.
       - Area consists of connected tiles of same "type". There are 4 types: Clean sand, Dunes, Spice and anything other.
Added: Made block selection from tileset much easier. You no more need to select predefined block size and then click to tileset,
       but you can select any block simply with mouse. (You can still use presets if you want.)
Fixed: When you resize map, the new empty space is filled with random sand
Added: "Test map" feature: you can now launch and test your map directly from the editor!
       Requirements:
       - You need to have modified version of Dune2000.exe, which supports mission launching.
         (It is distributed along with Mission launcher)
       - Dune2000.exe must be in parent directory of the directory where the map is saved
       - Counterpart .mis file must exist and there must be no map errors (missing Worm Spawners etc.)
       How it works:
       - Added "Test" menu with two options "Quick launch" and "Launch with settings"
       - "Quick launch" simply starts game with last settings
       - "Launch with settings" opens a window where you can set Difficulty, Mission number, Side you want to play as etc.
       - Mission number and Side is detected from map name's last 4 characters (like A4V1 - A for Side, 4 for mission).
       - For map names not having this name pattern you need to set them manually.
       - Before launching, map is saved into temporary file (TESTMAP.map) which is actually launched. 
       - Original map is not saved. Don't forget to save!
Added: "Create empty .mis file" feature: Creates .mis file with default settings, no events, no AI. Useful when creating new map. 
         


Aplha 0.5 (released 2015-05-02)
-------------------------------
Fixed: Map image is saved properly
Added: Program accepts map filename as parameter
Changed: New icon (by dato 2000)

Major terrain editing improvements:
- Selected tile block is drawn under mouse cursor when editing a map
- You can Drag&Scroll map while holding right button in terrain editing mode
- Fully functional Undo&Redo feature: you can undo/redo as many steps as you want (use Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y).
- Added "Select&Copy" feature: you can select area on a map with mouse (press left button and drag) 
  and then place that area somewhere in map or even in different map. You can choose to select
  area with or without structures (structures are not drawn on the selected block) 
- Added "Block key-presets" feature: This will let you draw cliffs and borders MUCH FASTER!!!
  Each key on keyboard (1, 2, 3, 4, Q, W, E, R, T, ect) has its block preset. Instead of selecting tile block 
  from tileset or from a list (like in Shai-Hulud editor), you just simply press key on keyboard and select 
  tile which you want. The layout of keys and their tiles is logical and intuitive (hopefully).
  Press key multiple times if there are more "versions" of the block.
  There are four preset groups: rock-sand cliff, sand-sand cliff, rock border, dunes border.
- Keyboard shortcuts were changed and there are several new.
  All old letters/numbers shortcurs now work with Shift (Shift+R for selecting Rock, Shift+2 for 2x2 block etc)
  New shortcuts: Shift+C for Select&Copy mode, F1-F4 for selecting key-preset group 
  Num2, Num4, Num6, Num8 for moving block on map (useful when you want to move it beyond upper or left map border)
  "`" (the key under Esc) for quick select of Sand/Rock/Dunes according to current key-preset group
