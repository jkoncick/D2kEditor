[Flag]
help=This condition is a true/false switch. It remembers its state (being true or false) which can be changed with event 19, "Set Flag". The initial state of every Flag condition is false._This condition is useful for implementing more complicated event-condition chains, where changing the Flag to true may affect many other events which depend on it._This type of condition is often used to make an event run only once. Such event is programmed to trigger only if the Flag is false. When the event triggers, there's also a "Set Flag" event which will set the Flag to true, blocking the event in question from triggering again. Run-once flags are somewhat archaic thanks to the introduction of the "Auto-block" feature, a tickbox on every event that prevents it from firing again after it runs once.__Flags are not entirely obsolete, however. Were you to right-click the events column and look under "Create events," you would see the "Harvester replacement" option. That little group of events makes use of a flag to determine when another Harvester should be delivered. Refer to that as an example when deciding if you need a flag or not.__Any condition assigned to an event that has its checkbox unchecked fires the event after returning true. Check the box to fire the event when the condition returns false.

[Random Chance]
help=A random number within defined Range is generated every tick. If the number is between the minimum and maximum values, the condition triggers. If it's some other number in the range of potential numbers, the condition is false.__Having a range of 100 with min and max values of 1 and 50 makes this condition a coin flip. Half chance that it returns true, half chance that it returns false.

The player could save the game just before the randomized event fires, then reload the saved game and get a different result. With a "Fixed result" value of 1 or higher, the state of this condition is decided at the start of the game. It will return the same results every time it's fired in the same game session. The only way to change that result is to restart the mission entirely.__"Fixed result" is not boolean. If you want to use the same range and min/max values, but with a different fixed result, use 2, 3, and so on in additional Random Chance conditions.
