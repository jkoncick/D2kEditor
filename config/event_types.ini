[Spice Bloom]

help=Forces the player's camera to the specified coordinates._The viewport position is locked (player cannot move camera) for duration of one tick after this event executes.

help=Transforms terrain at the specified location. The maximum number of tiles each Change Map Block event can handle is 12.__Start by mapping the tiles you want the terrain to be transformed to. Select those tiles with however many Change Map Block events you need to cover the whole area. Then, re-map the terrain to how you want it to be at the beginning of the map.__You can check how the transformed terrain looks on the map by right-clicking the event number in the area marker (ctrl+H).__Transforming the terrain also changes tile attributes. If passable tiles are changed to impassable, then units located at those tiles will be destroyed. If buildable tiles are changed to non-buildable, then buildings located at those tiles will be destroyed and concrete will be removed too. Spice will be removed on tiles changed to non-sandy. Tile damage is reset to 0.

[Transform Tiles]
help=Transforms all designated tile(s) into other tile(s) via index value. This change could be visual-only, making this sort of event useful for something like animating custom water tiles.__To get the index of a tile for use in this event, go to the map editor. Select the "Terrain" tab on the sidebar, then click "Open tileset." Check the "Preset Helper" box in the top right, then right-click a tile you need for the event. The third value in the preset code is the index.

[Add Building Destruction]
help=Adds a building destruction visual and sound effect and spawns debris, as if a building of the specified type were destroyed at the specified coordinates. The coordinates are the top left-most tile of the spawned building.__Technically, it spawns a building and then destroys it immediately. Due to how this works, spawning a building on top of units can affect them. Infantry belonging to a different side will despawn and vehicles will turn to the side the structure explosion belongs to. Structures under the tiles occupied by the destroyed building will no longer take up space._Use this event with caution to avoid these effects.__The destroyed building will not cause the 'Building lost' message from the mentat, nor will it spawn infantry or provide build radius.

[Set Tooltip Line]
help=This event must be used inside a hook block of type "Handle Tooltip" (event type 234). It can be used to customize tooltip text._Custom tooltips can have up to 10 lines. One event can be used to change a single line of tooltip, so use multiple events to change more lines.__You can either use any pre-defined text from TEXT.UIB table by Message ID, or use a custom text. Remember that each line of custom text must use a unique Message ID, and it will overwrite the original text from TEXT.UIB sharing the same ID._You can use variables within custom text. To refer to variables in the text of the message, use the @ symbol. The first @ symbol will refer to variable 1, the second @ refers to variable 2 and so on.

This will repeat infinitely, until the conditional expression is evaluated false._Make sure to modify the expression variables within the block, otherwise the block will execute infinitely and the game will crash.
