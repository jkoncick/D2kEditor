[AI_Help]
0=A fixed value that differentiates all sides. This value doesn't change when importing a preexisting AI. Don't touch this!
1=0 = The AI is inactive. Units still can move and shoot while an enemy side is near. Harvesters act as usual. This is inactive on the player's side, of course._1 = The AI is active. Units and structures may be built; the AI will send attacks, etc.
3=0 = The AI will behave like a Campaign type of AI. It won't expand the base nor sell its buildings when unable to earn more money or build more units._1 = The AI will behave like a Skirmish type of AI. It will deploy an MCV, expand the base, and sell its buildings if unable to earn more money or build more units.
4=0 = The AI won't order units through the starport._1 = The AI will order units through the starport._The AI's orders on easy difficulty are halved just like scripted reinforcement delivery events and the AI tends to place orders more urgently if running an excess of funds.
5=0 = The AI doesn't upgrade any buildings._1 = The AI upgrades its buildings. Upgrades take priority over everything else._The AI will immediately upgrade all buildings as soon as they can.
7=0 = If the AI runs out of energy and can't rebuild or afford to power its base, it may sell a building to have positive energy.*_1 = The AI will never sell its buildings.**_*Normal AIs will prefer to sell non-factory buildings first if low on power, like turrets or the Outpost._**Practice AIs still will sell all the buildings when out of options since they go berserk.
28=0 = AI heavy vehicles will only shoot at infantry units, though may crush by accident.*_1 = AI heavy vehicles may try to roll over and crush infantry units._*AI-owned Harvesters will crush infantry units regardless of the option chosen.
29=Both GuardBase and GuardBuildings should be enabled for GuardGroupSize and normal AI defense behaviors to function properly.
3926=Both GuardBase and GuardBuildings should be enabled for GuardGroupSize and normal AI defense behaviors to function properly.
7430=Unused/Unknown.
7444,7445=1 = Damaged units will go to the Repair Pad. This affects pre-placed units._0 = No units will be repaired._*Both RepairUnits and RepairGuardingUnits must be set to 1 for it to work. If either is 0, the AI won’t repair any of its units.
7492=0 = AI attacks at the defined time.*_1 = AI will synchronize its attack with a reinforcement near the defined time, if possible.*_*The defined time is set on the “First Attack Building Delay” and “Time Between Building Attacks” lines.
7493=0 = The AI doesn't rebuild buildings lost._1 = The AI rebuilds buildings lost if possible.
4235=1 = Units won't be set to face away from the Construction Yard at the start of mission.
6645=Normally, practice AI will go berserk if it loses all production buildings or run out of money. This setting controls this function._0 = Enabled only for practice AI (default behavior)_1 = Disabled_2 = Enabled also for non-practice AI
6646=AI prefers targeting human-controlled sides (sides with no AI) with superweapons. Setting this to 1 will remove this preference, so AI treats human-controlled and AI-controlled sides equally and may decide to attack even an AI-controlled side.
7428=How many Harvesters the AI will build per Refinery. It will build as many Harvesters as needed to fill this value. Harvesters have priority at the Heavy Factory over combat units and can be ordered from the Starport as well.
7429=How many Carryalls the AI will build per Refinery. It will build as many Carryalls as needed to fill this value. Carryalls can be ordered from the Starport as well.
3856=Time in tics the AI will wait before his first attack._The time is affected by "Timing Random Percentage".
3860=Time in tics the AI will wait every other attack after the first._Fixed timer, not affected by the "Timing Random Percentage"._Note: It’s recommended that the number ends with “00”, or else the AI may stop attacking because of a bug.
3901=% of the overall ready-to-attack units strength* that will be used to attack.**_*The strength is measured based on the hit points of the units. The first units produced will have priority while counting the % strength._**”Group Size Random Percentage” value adds power to the attacks at random.
3902=% of the overall units strength* the AI has that will be sent to protect their units**_*Same as above._**Only works if any of the “Protect Unit <unit>" lines is set to 1.
3903=% of the overall units strength* the AI has that will be sent to defend their buildings._*Same as above.
20=Unused / unknown.
3853=% of the strength* of the manually placed units (not being spawned) that will act as if they were spawned via a “Unit spawn” event._*Strength = Hit points.
3880=Time in tics that the AI will wait to build his next unit when under siege._This has priority over the “Unit Build Rate” value and ignores “CashStash” values.
3905,3916=Unused / unknown.
3920=Unused / unknown, but may be based in mathematics in base 2 (Binary).
3932=Strength* of the units that will walk around the buildings.**_*Strength = Hit points._**The size of the AI’s base affects this value proportionally.
3948=Unused / unknown.
3949=Unused / unknown.
3950=Randomizes the “First time Attack Building Delay” value by the specified percentage. May be positive or negative.
3951=Randomizes the “Attack Building Strength” value by the specified percentage.
7436=Time in tics the AI waits before repairing a building.
7440=Time in tics the AI waits before sending a unit to repair.
7448=Time in tics the AI waits until using special weapons (Fremen, Saboteur, Airstrike, Death Hand) from the beginning of the game.
7452=Unused / unknown.
7454=We don't really know how to manipulate Morale. However, if the AI's morale is low, it will not attack. MinMorale should be set to a high value, like 80, to ensure the AI continues to attack.
7455=Unused / unknown.
7468=Interval in tics between building new units, if possible.
7476=Time in tics the AI waits to react when a unit is under attack.
7480=Time in tics the AI waits to react when a building is under attack.
3952,4024=Unused / unknown.
4028,4100=Unused / unknown.
4104,4176=Unused / unknown.
4180=Unused / Unknown.
4184=If the AI has less credits than this amount, it will not repair buildings.*_*Unconfirmed.
4188=If the AI has less credits than this amount, it will not repair units.*_*Unconfirmed.
4192=If the AI has less credits than this amount, it will not build Harvesters.*_*Unconfirmed.
4196=If the AI has less credits than this amount, it will not build Carryalls.*_*Unconfirmed.
4200=If the AI has less credits than this amount, the AI won’t build any new buildings with the exception of Refineries.
4204=If the AI has less credits than this amount, the AI won’t build new units except Harvesters, which is dependent on the corresponding “CashStash” value for Harvesters. If no Refineries are present, the AI will build other units until it runs out of credits. The AI will also use reserve cash to build units if EmergencyBuildRate is active.
4208=Unused / Unknown.
4212=If the AI has less credits than this amount, it will not place an order at the Starport.
4221=The lower this number is, the less allied units need to die to make this AI to stop attacking or retreat for a certain time. To keep an AI attacking normally, just set this to 100 and forget about it.
4216,4234=Unused / unknown.
4236,4632=Unused / Unknown.
4636,5032=The higher the value, more probable it is the AI will attack a particular building._AIs prioritize human players. If all the values are 0, the AI will attack the nearest unit or building possible belonging to any enemy.
5036,5432=The HP threshold the AI will wait until starting to repair the specific building. By default, the value is at 0.660, which means 66% of the total Hit Points. With 0.000, the AI never repairs the building. With 0.999, repairs start as soon as the building is damaged.
5436,5832=Operates similarly to the build speed value for units and structures. 922 / the value specified in TimeBeforeRebuilding = roughly the in-game seconds before the AI will start rebuilding the given structure.
5836,6232=Sets the order for the AI to build available structures (concrete is not affected)._Will start with highest value. The ratio is divided as more structures are placed._For example, let's say the AI is meant to build 3 Wind Traps and 2 Refineries:_BuildRatio Wind Trap = 9.000_BuildRatio Refinery = 5.000_An AI building up from scratch will build WT1 (9), Ref1 (5), WT2 (9/2=4.5), WT3 (9/3=3), then Ref2 (5/2=2.5). Decimals are fully accounted for in calculations. You should account for power, available cash before Refinery, and other such things yourself when calculating BuildRatios since the AI will build exactly what you tell it to build in exactly the order you specify._BuildRatios apply to both practice and campaign mode AIs and determine what the AI will choose to rebuild if multiple structures are down. A structure with a BuildRatio of 0.000 will not be rebuilt.
6236,6632=Maximum amount of the specific buildings that this AI will build. Only affects an AI in practice mode.
6637,6644=The higher the value, the greater the chance is that the AI will attack the specified side.
6648,6884=Set the proportions which the AI will build all the units available._Example:_This AI has these priorities on these units*_Unit Build Priority Infantry = 5.000_Unit Build Priority Trooper =3.000_Unit Build Priority Trike = 1.000_This means that for every Trike built, 3 Troopers and 5 Infantry will be trained (or vice versa)._*Decimals can be used.
6888,7124=The HP threshold the AI will wait until sending the unit to the Repair Pad. By default, the value is at 0.500, which means 50% of the total Hit Points. With 0.000, the AI never repairs the vehicle. With 0.999, as soon as the unit is damaged and not performing another task it will be sent to the Repair Pad.
7368,7427=Setting any unit to 1 will make the AI react when that specific type of unit is attacked, sending units to protect it.
7505,7604=Defense Areas: The number of defense areas that should be active. Using more than 2 for one AI may crash the game._Defend Area # Min X, Max X, Min Y, Max Y: Coordinates for the corresponding defense area. The AI will keep units on rock tiles within defense areas to prevent units from being eaten by the worm. They will still stage attacks on any aggressors within the defense area from wherever the safety of rock is found. If no rock it’s on the area they will move to the center of the rectangle without moving around, but they still will defend against any invader that enter that area._Defend Area # Unknown 1: Set this to 255.*_Defend Area # Unknown 2: This value define the strength** that the AI will use to send units to defend this area._Defend Area # Start Delay: Time in tics before the AI will occupy this defense area with available units._Defend Area# Unknown 3: Set this to 25000.*_*These are currently still unknown. The listed values were used in a defense area found in the original game._**Strength = Hit points.
